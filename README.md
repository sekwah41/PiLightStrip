# PiLightStrip
Lightshows for the AdaFruit light strip

Download the https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x as it is a needed library

One major issue with this setup is the lights use the audio pins to run, so you should buy a usb audio driver to run this.

Will probably make a music/dj system to work with mobile over a webserver at some point reusing this code
